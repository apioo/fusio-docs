# Marketplace

The marketplace provides a way to install apps from the Fusio marketplace. Those apps are mostly
small Javascript apps which work with the Fusio API. 

In some cases it is for security reasons not allowed to dynamically install apps from the backend,
in this case it is possible to disable the marketplace at the configuration.
