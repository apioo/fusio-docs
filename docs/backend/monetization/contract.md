# Contract

The contract panel shows all available contracts. Fusio creates a contract if a user has purchased a plan. This can be
either a one-time purchase or a recurring contract. If the purchased plan has a configured interval Fusio will
automatically create an invoice for each interval i.e. monthly. The user needs then to pay this invoice at the developer
app.
