# App

An app enables the consumer to request an access token through the app key and
secret. With the access token it is possible to request protected API
endpoints. There is a default consumer implementation located at `developer/`
which enables a user to manage their apps. The consumer can use any OAuth2 client
to request an access token. Fusio supports by default the `authorization_code`,
`implicit` and `password` grant type. Please take a look at the [OAuth2] RFC for
more information about the flow.

## Authorization code

At first you have to redirect the client to the consumer endpoint containing
the app key, redirect uri and the needed scopes i.e.:
`/developer/auth?response_type=code&client_id=[key]&redirect_uri=[url]&scope=foo,bar`.
After the user has authenticated he approves or denies the access. If he accepts
the user gets redirected to the provided `redirect_uri`. Note the `redirect_uri`
must have the same host as the url which was provided for the app. The callback
contains a GET parameter `code` which can be [exchanged] for an access token at
the `/authorization/token` endpoint.

## Implicit

Mostly used for javascript apps. Like in the authorization code flow the app
redirects the user to the consumer endpoint i.e.:
`/developer/auth?response_type=token&client_id=[key]&redirect_uri=[url]&scope=foo,bar`
If the user has authenticated and approved the app the user gets redirected to
the `redirect_uri`. The callback contains the access token in the [fragment]
component. The access tokens which are issued through the implicit grant have
usually a much shorter life time because they are more insecure. It is also
possible to deactivate the implicit grant through the configuration.

## Password

A user can use the password grant to obtain directly an access token with
their username and password. Therefor he has to send a [direct] request to the
`/authorization/token` endpoint.
