# Form

A form helps to build a frontend UI to consume your API. The idea is to select a target operation
and additionally a UI-Schema which contains a JSON string to describe how the form looks.
Fusio does not force you to select a specific UI-Schema you are free to choose the fitting format
depending on your frontend for example [JSON Forms](https://jsonforms.io/). 

## Configuration

### Name

The name of the form

### Operation

The target operation of the form

### UI-Schema

An additional UI-Schema which represents the form. At the frontend you can render the form with a fitting
frontend library like [JSON Forms](https://jsonforms.io/)
