# Test

At the test panel it is possible to test the quality of your API. The "Refresh" button goes through each operation and
adds them to the test panel. Then it is possible to configure i.e. uri fragments, parameters or request bodies to invoke
your operation successfully. After this you can use the "Run" button to execute the tests.
