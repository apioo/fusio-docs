# Util A/B Test

At this action you can configure two actions A and B. These actions are then called based on a provided distribution.
A distribution means that there is a 50% chance to invoke either action A or B. A distribution of 80% means that there
is an 80% chance to invoke action A and 20% to invoke action B. You can use this action i.e. if you want to test a new
action and you dont want to test that action on all users.
