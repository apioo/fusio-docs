# Event

Fusio has an event system which helps to build a pub/sub system. This means consumer of your API can subscribe to
specific events. Inside your API endpoint you can then trigger such an event. Fusio will then send the payload to each
subscriber in the background.

## Installation

To enable Fusio to send messages at the background you need to activate the Cronjob feature. The event system creates a
cronjob which distributes the pending events.

## Subscribe

To subscribe for such an event the user needs to send a HTTP POST request to the `/consumer/subscription` endpoint with
the following payload:

```json
{
  "event": "my_event",
  "endpoint": "http://my-app.com/callback"
}
```

## Publish

To publish an event you need to use the dispatcher to create an event. I.e. the following action shows how to dispatch
data to the event "my_event" which then will send the provided data JSON encoded to the subscribed endpoints.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Todo;

use Fusio\Engine\ActionAbstract;
use Fusio\Engine\ContextInterface;
use Fusio\Engine\ParametersInterface;
use Fusio\Engine\RequestInterface;

class Collection extends ActionAbstract
{
    public function handle(RequestInterface $request, ParametersInterface $configuration, ContextInterface $context)
    {
        // dispatch my event
        $this->dispatcher->dispatch('my_event', [
            'foo' => 'bar'
        ]);
    }
}
```

## Callback

Fusio will send the following HTTP POST request to every subscribed endpoint. In case the endpoint returns a non
successful status code Fusio will try to resend the message up to 3 times.

```
POST /callback HTTP/1.1
Host: my-app.com
Content-Type: application/json
User-Agent: Fusio/4.0.2@916a81045349cc0e149873b5b794777bb5f29a30

{"foo": "bar"}
```
