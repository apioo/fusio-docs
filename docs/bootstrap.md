# Getting started

To get started you need at first a running installation of Fusio. If you have not already installed Fusio please take a
look at the [installation](installation) page. This page will explain the first steps in Fusio, that means we create a
route at the backend which executes a specific action and we create a schema which describes the payload of our action.
