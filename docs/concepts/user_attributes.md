# User attributes

If you build an app and use the authorization system of Fusio you might want to extend the default user table with
additional columns i.e. first- and last name (by default the user table contains only the most basic fields: username,
email and password). Fusio has a system called user attributes which let you easily add arbitrary attributes to each
user account. Therefor you need to define the allowed attributes in the file `configuration.php` i.e.:

```
'fusio_user_attributes'   => [
    'first_name',
    'last_name',
],
```

Then it is possible to update the defined properties for each user by sending an PUT request to the `/consumer/account`
endpoint. This changes the attributes of the current authenticated user.

```json
{
  "email": "foo@bar.com",
  "attributes": {
    "first_name": "Sebastian",
    "last_name": "Bach",
  }
}
```

This allows you to build a complete custom user profile page which contains all fields for a user account which you
need.
