# API Framework

Using Fusio as API Framework means that you don't need to use the backend app
to configure your API, instead you store the complete Fusio configuration in
simple YAML files which you can also save in a GIT repository. Besides this, you
can also develop custom actions for each operation. To get started, you can take
a look at our [Fusio-Framework](https://github.com/apioo/fusio-framework)
repository.
