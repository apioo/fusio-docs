# API Framework

Using Fusio as API Framework means, that you don`t need to use the backend app
to configure your API, instead you store the complete Fusio configuration in
simple yaml files which you can also save in a GIT repository. Besides this you
can also develop custom actions for each operation.

You can take a look at our [headless CMS](https://github.com/apioo/fusio-sample-cms) sample
app, which shows a complex example app.
