# Integration REST

You can integrate all functionality of Fusio through the internal API. To get on overview about all available endpoints
you can take a look at our [documentation app](https://demo.fusio-project.org/apps/documentation/). There you can select
as category "backend" or "consumer" to see either the backend or consumer API.
