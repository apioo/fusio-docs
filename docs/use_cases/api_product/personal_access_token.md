# Personal Access Token

To access protected operations of your API you need an access token. Fusio
provides a personal access token feature similar to GitHub where you can
manually create an access token which you can then use directly to access
your API. You can create such a token directly at the backend or developer
portal app under your account s.

If you create a token you can also select the scopes which should belong to
the token. Through this you only need to include the needed scopes which
increases the security.
