# Import external specification

To import an existing specification into Fusio you need to go to the routes panel and click there on the top right
briefcase button, then you should see the following dialog:

![routes_provider_openapi](/img/use_cases/routes_provider_openapi.png)

There you can select one of the following importer at the class field:

* OpenAPI
* Postman
* Insomnia

At the specification field you can then insert your target specification. If you click on the `Changelog` button you
will see all routes, actions and schemas which this import creates. Through the `Save` button you start the actual
import.
